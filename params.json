Install it on a server and you are ready to begin indexing\r\ninformation from directories and other sources of business details.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n\r\n1. OpenCV <br>\r\n2. Python 2.7 <br>\r\n3. Django 1.7 <br>\r\n4. Celery 3.1.18<br>\r\n5. Tesseract OCR 3.02 <br>\r\n6. OCROpus <br>\r\n7. PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) 3.6 <br>\r\n8. FuzzyWuzzy\r\n9. Scikit-learn\r\n\r\n##Setting it Up\r\n\r\nInstall the requirements and fire up celery :\r\n\r\n    celery -A ScanDB worker --loglevel=info\r\n\r\nOnce the celery worked is up and running, start the Django server :\r\n\r\n    python manage.py runserver\r\n\r\n##Users\r\n\r\nThere are 2 user types.\r\n\r\n###Admin\r\n\r\nThe Admin can add users, upload scanned documents and verify any deleted documents by the users.\r\n\r\n###Users\r\n\r\nThe users can see the scanned image and the extracted information, verify if it is correct and\r\nproceed to click 'Next' or 'Delete' as appropriate. This step is used to train the OCR in correcting\r\nerrors after the text is produced by Tesseract.\r\n\r\nThe process may be completely automated once a sufficient confidence level is acheived.\r\n\r\n##How does it Work?\r\n\r\n* Auto - Thresholding\r\n* De - Skewing of Scanned Documents\r\n* Binarisation\r\n* Extracting segments of information from scanned pages\r\n* Line Extraction\r\n* OCR by Tesseract\r\n* Correcting OCR with Spell Check, Fuzzy String Matching\r\n* Correcting OCR with learned Neural Network from User corrections\r\n* Regular Expressions for Details like Email, Website, Phone Number etc.\r\n* Analysing Tokens\r\n* Parsing Tokens with a Stochastic Layout Parser\r\n* Layout Parser uses an LR Grammar\r\n* Validating Information\r\n* Showing Information to User\r\n* Learning from Corrections made\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
